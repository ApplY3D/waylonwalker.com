I am challenging myself to 30 days of dotfile ricing.  I have been on linux
desktop for a few months now and have a pretty good workflow going, I have the
coarse edits done to my workflow, but it has some rough edges that need sanded
down.  It's time to squash some of those little annoyances that still exist in
my setup.


This is primarily going to be focused on productivity, but may have  a few
things to just look better.  This will comprise heavily of aliases, zsh, and
nvim config.
