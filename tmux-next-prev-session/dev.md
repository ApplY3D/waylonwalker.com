Now that we are splitting up work into their own sessions, lets talk about how to navigate between them without the command line.  Navigating sessions is what kept me using a too many splits and windows workflow for far too long.  It was rough, I was always tripping over panes and windows until I got too frustrated and just ran `tmux kill-server`  to start on a new blank slate.
