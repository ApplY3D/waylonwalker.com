Both kids are starting to sleep again, we switched their medicine around and
are doing things like thier vitamins in the morning and compensated some others
for their increased age/weight.  It's been weeks since Wyatt has made it past
3am, and its been wearing on everyone, we are all quite tired from the
interrupted or lack of sleep.

Today we met with Ayla's surgical team again.  We are making some great
progress to giving her some independence back, having daily bowel movements, no
accidents, and we might not need to go the surgical route.  She has been
handling the new routine like a champ and we are all getting figuring out how
to make the best of it.  Despite what it is, it often gives me and her some
time together where we are both a bit silly and trying to not let the stress of
the routine get to us.
