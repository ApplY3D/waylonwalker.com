Chemo day today, and it seemed like an ok one this time round, Rhiannon was able to get a good rest in this afternoon.  That always seems to help her quite a bit.  The house paperwork is flying in and rhiannon is squashing it as fast as it hits our inbox.  I help with what I can, but honestly most of it is done within minutes of it getting to us.  She is really crushing this beast mode.
