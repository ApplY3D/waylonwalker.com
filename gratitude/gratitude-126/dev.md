title: Gratitude 126

We are getting ghosted by sellers again, they are really cramping the style on this whole gratitude journal.  I am very grateful that we have a great team on our end trying to get us into a house that we love before we are sent out of this one.  They are really doing everything that they can to help us, it's just hard when there is no response from the other end.  This house really meets so many of our wishes, many wishes that we didnt even realize that we had.  It's hard to look at other houses, especially when most are more in the city and more expensive.   We still have our hopes up.  We really want a house that our whole family can love and we can grow together in without worry about where we are going to be living next.
