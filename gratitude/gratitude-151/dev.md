Today felt like a mostly productive day, I got some good packing in. Played with the kids.  Wyatt and I continued on with our amazing boat course in minecraft.

At the end of the day Dobby and I had a huge play session with lots of heavy running back and fourth.  He got a huge workout. I have never seen him move like that, but I could see that it really made him very happy to play that heavy with someone.
