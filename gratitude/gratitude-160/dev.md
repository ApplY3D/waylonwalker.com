Nearly finished.  We have the keys to our old house for one more day, and we are co close to being finished with it.  Rhiannon has been crushing it over there, like seriously ðŸ¦µ crushing it.  She spent most of the day there with the move out cleanup maids, and has gone back to pick up the last of the clutter, skim coat holes in the wall, and paint.  It is looking remarkable over there by the video I have seen of the place.
