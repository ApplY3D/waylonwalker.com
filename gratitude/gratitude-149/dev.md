I am so proud of Ayla and all of the progress she has made lately.  She is doing really well with Mr. Black, her teacher from school.  He has been really good at helping us navigate what to expect.  Rhiannon has been giving her gum during school and it really seems to help her ability to focus and work.

She has been doing really well with her peristeen and getting her independence back.  It's really hard for her to want to do it, but she does really good at understanding that she needs to do it.

Today she gave me her number, oh and her house is 4.
