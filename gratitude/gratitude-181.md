Getting back into a rythm.  It's been crazy around here with my broken leg, but
things are finally finding their way back into a somewhat normal rythm.  Today
was Saturday and it was fairly focused on playing with the kids hacking on my
blog, and running an errand with everyone.  I nearly have my blog tooling fixed
up from the issues I was having with copier, and now understand why it was
completely deleting projects any time it had an issue.  I also got my
screenshot tool up and running in full force.  I can now take screenshots,
publish them, and paste right into my blog with a single key.  This is
something that I have really been wanting to add to my workflow for a long
time, and am pretty excited to have it running.
