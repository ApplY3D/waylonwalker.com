It's Christmas eve and the love and excitement is in the air.  It's definitely been a chaotic day with emotions going high and low.  Ayla has been singing her heart out, she even recorded one on Mommy's phone and sent it to me.  Wyatt and I hav play many rounds of Minecraft, installed a crazy number of new mods, and got a few rounds of 0AD in.


Best of all we had a special supper, and enjoyed a movie all together, that's right Wyatt, the king of not being able to stay put for 5 mintues enjoyed at least half a movie with us before we cut out early to go play.  I am so grateful that I have this time off to enjoy with them and see them just so happy and joyful.

Merry Christmas Everyone.
