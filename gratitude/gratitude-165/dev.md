This afternoon Wyatt and I went on a big skate throught the neighborhood.  He had such a good time he wanted to do a second lap, and another later right at dark.  I am grateful that the sidewalks are so nice for us to ride on wtih very few cracks that would fully take anyone out. The traffic is also very mild.   There are very few cars on the roads and the ones that are there are all going at a vy nice pace.  No one really races through our neighborhood.
