  <p>This morning I was graced with the greatest mood that my son could possibly have.  He
  was incredibly courteous, grateful, willing to do things on his own.  He got himself
  dressed, put his own shoes on, and when I told him that we had an early morning
  Dr. appointment he did not throw a fit and was 100% on board with going.  He was
  at the top of his game, and as happy as could be.</p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>Watching his gratitude and positivity shine this morning was more thatn enough
  motivation to start my day off on the right foot.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>These are the moments that we long for as parents, and it is important to not
  brush over them and forget them.  It''s important to to watch him grow into a great
  meaningful member of society.  Watching his gratitude and positivity shine this
  morning was more thatn enough motivation to start my day off on the right foot,
  and we did. We dropped off Ayla at preschool, attended his Dr. Appointment then
  came back to play and continue our wonderful morning.</p>'
