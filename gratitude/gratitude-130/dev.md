In my 32 years I cannot recall ever dropping an f-bomb in front of my mom, heck besides a short period in my life were I developed shop mouth I rarely drop one.  Like twice a year at most.  Tonight it was not only in her presence, it was directed right at her.  I am still processing how I feel about it, but I think it was a discussion that was a long time coming that we needed to have. I'm glad to get it off my chest, but I also feel lost and not quite sure where to go from here.
