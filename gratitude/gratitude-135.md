  him to be home with us.  Everyone is.  Its just so joyful to see the excitement

  that everyone has for him.  Rhiannon has done some fantastic research to

  understan what we need to do to trai him properly.  We have never gotten a pet

  that was not a rescue.  This was in part to knowing the family he is coming

  wanted him to be trained from t start for what she needs him to do.  So excited

  for the big day.</p>'
