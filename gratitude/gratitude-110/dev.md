Really the last day before it all starts back up.  Today, I totally thought it was a work day.  Got dressed and everything, popped out the laptop and realized it was a floating holiday.  Well it was a good dry run, cause after a few weeks off getting up and at em on top of getting everyone their things they need in the morning I was not getting going at the normal time.

Today Ayla and I had a fantastic coloring session.  We each made some heart eye emojis to give to each other and they turned out awesome.  She even cut them out for me.
