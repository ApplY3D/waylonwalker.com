  <p>Currently I have a broken leg and its not so easy to get up and down, so I was

  pushing him a little harder than I maybe should have.  I really just wanted him

  to take some responsibility and at least help in some way.  I did a great job

  at calmly talking through it with him, but I was not able to help.  But we only

  went backwards, more legos ended up on the floor than were actually picked up

  did not push hard, I just stayed with him and talked to him.</p>

  <p>Where I failed is communicating with Rhiannon,  you see she was down with him

  for about 15 mintues before she had to go.  Once she left I gave them both a

  pretty gracious break before we got back to cleaning up.  All felt mostly good,

  but what I did not realize is that she agreed with him that he had already done

  enough with her and did not need to participate anymore.</p>

  <p>In all, its been quite awhile since I have not just simply picked up after him

  with very little question.  I feel like I learned something from this

  experience and hope we all have a better day tomorrow.</p>'
