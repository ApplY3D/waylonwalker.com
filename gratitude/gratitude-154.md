Big play session tonight with Dobby and the kids, everyone was sprinting
through the basement like crazy.  All with HUGE smiles on their face. We ran so
hard for so long that eventually dobby just stopped and laid down.

that it was soo calming for him and he just loved it.  Generally they are both
just so high energy that Wyatt inadvertantly gets nipped and does not like it.

Also got a bunch of boxes packed up!
