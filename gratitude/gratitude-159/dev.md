Laundry room is working!  It appears that for years the dryer vent has been just kinda set on top of the hole in the floor, not attached at all..... This had blown dryer lint over everything in the laundry room, and I am curious if it contributed tot he excessive duest on everyting in the whole house.  I got it all cleaned out and hooked up to the best of my ability.  The connections have a solid couple inches overlap and taped tight.

The one issue that we ran into was. I fully setup the washer, then pulled it back out, and forgot to put the drain back on before running a load and draining in onto the floor.
