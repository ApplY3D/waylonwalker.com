  high on

  everyone.  I am not sure what has been going on for the last few months,

  but I feel so bad for Rhiannon.  I just want to support her, show my

  love, and give her everything she needs on chemo day, but lately it''s

  been hard.  There has been some emotional toll that seems to just

  multiply on everyone and make it really hard to put her at the forefront

  without everything else falling apart.  I wish I understood it better.

  Hopefully we can find our groove again and get back to giving her what

  she needs on these days.</p>'

It's Chemo Day once again.  And once again the emotional toll is high on
everyone.  I am not sure what has been going on for the last few months,
but I feel so bad for Rhiannon.  I just want to support her, show my
love, and give her everything she needs on chemo day, but lately it's
been hard.  There has been some emotional toll that seems to just
multiply on everyone and make it really hard to put her at the forefront
without everything else falling apart.  I wish I understood it better.
Hopefully we can find our groove again and get back to giving her what
she needs on these days.
