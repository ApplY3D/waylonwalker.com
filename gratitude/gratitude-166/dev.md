Happy Birthday Rhiannon, I love the chill day that we had.  Sometimes Birthdays get over hyped the the kids kinda go over board, but today they just did fantastic.  We started with a great trip to Hy Vee to pick up the cake, flowers, and a few extras.  We came back and set up decorations just in time for my first and only real meeting of the day. Had a good lunch date that included pop tarts and a cinnamon role doughnut.  Then Rhiannon spent the afternoon dying her hair, and it came out with just the most vibrant purple, it looks so good on her. Finished up the day with a great potato soup, as requested, and cake. Getting ready to go kick her butt in game night now.  Just because it's her birthday does not mean she can't lose at some games.
