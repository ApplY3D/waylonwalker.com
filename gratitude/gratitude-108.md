What a blizzard.  Wyatt and I braved the cold, had a snowball fight,
scooped the front sidewalk and just explored.  This is probably the most
snow Wyatt has yet to see, it was magnificently beautful.  I am so
grateful to have this time off each year to really spend time with the
family without feeling like I constantly need to get to something.
