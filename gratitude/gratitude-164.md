Today we went on a family walk around the block and met some of the nicest
neighbors.  I am so grateful that we have a nice neighborhood to take the whole
family on walks around.  Dobby did so good at his leash training.  Ayla and I
collected trash to throw away, and Wyatt was way ahead of us all with a
skateboard.  I am so proud of Ayla, part way through it started to sprinkle on
us and she stayed relatively calm and collected.
