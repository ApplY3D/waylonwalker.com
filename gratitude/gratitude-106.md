  is coming

  down with something that is hitting her hard.  No covid symptoms yet, we are

  hoping that its not that.  Anyways multiple times today she had asked what are

  the kids doing. Which is weird because they usually let you know what they are

  doing without needing to ask.</p>

  <p>We were back to Minecraft, this morning we jumped straight into it, all three
  of

  us.  I am really proud of how far Wyatt has come towards welcoming and helping

  Ayla.  He is doing really well at accepting her and letting her in more to play

  with us.  Not that he doesn''t, we do all get time to interact together, but its

  just becoming more and more regular.</p>'

Today was a super calm and chill day. It worked out because Rhiannon is coming
down with something that is hitting her hard.  No covid symptoms yet, we are
hoping that its not that.  Anyways multiple times today she had asked what are
the kids doing. Which is weird because they usually let you know what they are
doing without needing to ask.

We were back to Minecraft, this morning we jumped straight into it, all three of
us.  I am really proud of how far Wyatt has come towards welcoming and helping
Ayla.  He is doing really well at accepting her and letting her in more to play
with us.  Not that he doesn't, we do all get time to interact together, but its
just becoming more and more regular.
