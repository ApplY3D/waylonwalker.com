title: Gratitude 125

We heard back from the owners of our house! As exciting as it is they still kinda left us hanging.  They admitted to just ghosting everyone and that they will get back to us tomorrow.  It's frustrating that there are so many layers in between us, but at the same time I am grateful for the team of people helping us.  There is so much that goes into buying a house that We would never think of wtihout tons of research.


Today Was the repeat trip back to Iowa City, another 12 hours in the car for the kids.  I am so grateful for how supportive they are of Rhiannon, they will do anything for her.  It was a bit chaotic at times, but overall I am proud of them for getting through this stressfull trip.
