Rhiannon is kicking butt today ðŸ¦µ!  She finished setting up our movers, started looking into full house cleaning services.  And the greatest jeans ever came in the mail... for me!  I've wore holes right through my favorite jeans that I wear every single day, and have been needing to replace them.  She went the extra mile and researched the most comfortable dad jeans ever.  Mom jeans are a pretty popular thing, and keep your crack in, Dad jeans though, I was completely convinced these did not exist.  She found some.  They fit and move so much better than my old ones.
