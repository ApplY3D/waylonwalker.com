#### Feeling Good

Lately I have been feeling great!  Literally great.  We have had a ton going on for awhile and its been a long time that I have truely felt this great.  The benefits are astounding.  They say that you can only help others when you are capable of helping yourself, _oh how that is so true_.  I feel like lately I have been able to keep my cool and help everyone else much better than when not feeling on top of my game.
