Tonight was the first night with Ayla's new routine and it went very
well.  I could tell it was much easier and more comfortable for her.

I got to see our new house today during the home inspection, and it
looks very nice. It has plenty of space for all of us, and should be
much more maintainable at about half the total square feet that we are
in right now.  We are all excited to pick out our paint colors and start
designing out our own spaces.  The home inspection went quite well.
There was some small maintenance things that he pointed out, but it was
all really good.
