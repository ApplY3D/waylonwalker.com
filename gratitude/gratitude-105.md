We've switched to scratch.  My son and I have one on one time twice per day,
usually right at his chaotic times while medicine is kicking in.  Generally
it's Minecrafts as that is a safe place to be as chaotic as we need to be, but
today its been a day of scratch.  Its fun to see how quickly he is picking it
up, he is already on his own setting up new sprites, reskinning them, and
setting up keys to move them around.  I step in with some things that are just
outside of his zone.  The first time we go through it, it seems like he is
paying no attention and does not care, but after a few times of going through a
concept he seems to be picking it up.

I have really been trying to get him to do the problem solving as much as
possible, so if we are paired up and I am "writing" the code, I try to get him
to drive as much as possible.  Even if its not a direct we need a forever
block, describing to me what the sprite should do and what the player needs to
do to make it happen is a huge step.  I try to make him give me as small of a
step as he can without pushing too hard because I understand that it is his
time that he is a bit chaotic.

I am so grateful that this technology exists and we can make games together.
This is totally not something I had as a kid and would have loved to have or
