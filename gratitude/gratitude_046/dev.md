#### Kid Help

I am very grateful that we have help with the kids when we need it on a moments notice.  Today I came home with a migrane, and was able to rest up for a little while before helping them with bedtime.  Rather than pushing though and being miserable, I was able to take a short break then proceed with a nice night with the kids and Rhiannon.
