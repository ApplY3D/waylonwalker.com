They are still MIA, we have our hopes up that somethings serious happened, or they are taking the holiday weekend off.  We still have time, but not much, so we started looking into alternatives today so that we arent without a house before this is done.

Rhiannon and I are back to watching supercross as date nights on Saturday.  We took a few years off after an event that happened in Daytona.  We are both really enjoying trying to figure out what has changed since we stopped and watching together each week.
