  <p>Breaks are a good time for refresh and focus on some other things.  During this
  holiday break I have been able to spend quite a bit of time with my beautiful wife
  Rhiannon.  I have really enjoyed helping her setup her new adventure <a href="www.cuttinscrap.com">Cuttin
  Scrap</a>.  It will be a nice creative outlet for her to combine her love of sewing
  and crafting with her love of speech and writing.  I am really excited to see her
  get going.</p>

  <p>We have also spent some time at nights playing games and watching YouTube.  Its
  really nice to not have to worry about anything work related and focus on the family.  The
  extra time has helped strengthen our marriage and allow us to discuss some things
  that have been on our minds for awhile.  Now its time to start 2018 Fresh and Strong.</p>'

#### Breaks

Breaks are a good time for refresh and focus on some other things.  During this holiday break I have been able to spend quite a bit of time with my beautiful wife Rhiannon.  I have really enjoyed helping her setup her new adventure [Cuttin Scrap](www.cuttinscrap.com).  It will be a nice creative outlet for her to combine her love of sewing and crafting with her love of speech and writing.  I am really excited to see her get going.


We have also spent some time at nights playing games and watching YouTube.  Its really nice to not have to worry about anything work related and focus on the family.  The extra time has helped strengthen our marriage and allow us to discuss some things that have been on our minds for awhile.  Now its time to start 2018 Fresh and Strong.
