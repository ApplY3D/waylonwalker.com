title: Gratitude 175

Not a year goes by where this is not a tough day for her, but every year progress is made.  Healing was put on hold for many years, and did not start until she was truly able to grieve for what was lost.  Since then she has made so many improvements to herself, she has put in so much work that it is easier.  The hard days around this one get fewer and fewer.  Her power on this day grows strong.  All I can say is that I am damn proud of what she has accomplished.
