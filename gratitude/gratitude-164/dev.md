title: Gratitude 164

Today we went on a family walk around the block and met some of the nicest neighbors.  I am so grateful that we have a nice neighborhood to take the whole family on walks around.  Dobby did so good at his leash training.  Ayla and I collected trash to throw away, and Wyatt was way ahead of us all with a skateboard.  I am so proud of Ayla, part way through it started to sprinkle on us and she stayed relatively calm and collected.
