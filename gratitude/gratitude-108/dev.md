What a blizzard.  Wyatt and I braved the cold, had a snowball fight, scooped the front sidewalk and just explored.  This is probably the most snow Wyatt has yet to see, it was magnificently beautful.  I am so grateful to have this time off each year to really spend time with the family without feeling like I constantly need to get to something.
