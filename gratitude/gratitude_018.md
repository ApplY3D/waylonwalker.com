  <p>Tonight was the last night of the big holiday vacation and I finally got that
  special moment with every single family member over break.  It was Ayla''s turn
  tonight.  We had our break when Wyatt wanted mommy to play MineCraft with him and
  did not want daddy to play.  Ayla''s hair looked like a bird was trying to built
  its nest in it.  We made our way upstairs with a spray bottle, comb, brush and a
  whole lot of excitement.  We filled the spray bottle with water, and I let Ayla
  start going to town spraying everything in sight.  Although it was explicitly stated
  that it would not be used for its intended purpose, detangling hair.  Thats ok though
  as I was able to get some moisture in with my hands.  I continued to do my first
  french braid on her.  The first attempt was a fail as Ayla was moving too much and
  I lost it.  The second attemt was a success.  After this Ayla proceeded to water,
  brush, wipe, and comb daddy''s har over the next hour!</p>

  <p>I ran out of time, but I will still mention that she painted her first set of
  toes.</p>

#### My First French Braid

Tonight was the last night of the big holiday vacation and I finally got that special moment with every single family member over break.  It was Ayla's turn tonight.  We had our break when Wyatt wanted mommy to play MineCraft with him and did not want daddy to play.  Ayla's hair looked like a bird was trying to built its nest in it.  We made our way upstairs with a spray bottle, comb, brush and a whole lot of excitement.  We filled the spray bottle with water, and I let Ayla start going to town spraying everything in sight.  Although it was explicitly stated that it would not be used for its intended purpose, detangling hair.  Thats ok though as I was able to get some moisture in with my hands.  I continued to do my first french braid on her.  The first attempt was a fail as Ayla was moving too much and I lost it.  The second attemt was a success.  After this Ayla proceeded to water, brush, wipe, and comb daddy's har over the next hour!
