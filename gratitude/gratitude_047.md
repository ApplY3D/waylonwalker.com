  <p>Its not something that is handed out by participation.  Being part of the battle
  does not earn bravery.  Defeating the odds,  going into a battle with passion for
  the end result, and putting all of your heart into it.  Thats what defines bravery
  to me.  Last night I saw two family members give excelent examples of bravery.  Last
  night was the preschool prom night.  Ayla was unable to go, and Rhiannon was very
  passionate about going with Wyatt.  She has not been feeling well, and being around
  lots of poeple can make it very difficult at times, but she did it.  She was able
  to overcome the odds and make it through the prom for him. The other great example
  of bravery was Wyatt.  While in a very excited mood, with a lot going on around
  him.  He was able to stand by his mothers side, hold her hand, ask her if she was
  ok, and ask if there was anything he could do to help her through a rough spot.  He
  was able to overcome his ADHD, take a deep breath and stand strong for his mother.  This
  is not the first time that he has done this.  He has been growing up into a brave
  boy lately.</p>

#### Bravery
