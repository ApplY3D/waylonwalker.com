We heard back from the owners of our house! As exciting as it is they still
kinda left us hanging.  They admitted to just ghosting everyone and that they
will get back to us tomorrow.  It's frustrating that there are so many layers
in between us, but at the same time I am grateful for the team of people
helping us.  There is so much that goes into buying a house that We would never
think of wtihout tons of research.


Today Was the repeat trip back to Iowa City, another 12 hours in the car for
the kids.  I am so grateful for how supportive they are of Rhiannon, they will
do anything for her.  It was a bit chaotic at times, but overall I am proud of
them for getting through this stressfull trip.
