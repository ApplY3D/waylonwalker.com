  definitely been a chaotic day with emotions going high and low.  Ayla

  has been singing her heart out, she even recorded one on Mommy''s phone

  that''s right Wyatt, the king of not being able to stay put for 5 mintues

  enjoyed at least half a movie with us before we cut out early to go

  play.  I am so grateful that I have this time off to enjoy with them and

  see them just so happy and joyful.</p>

  <p>Merry Christmas Everyone.</p>'

It's Christmas eve and the love and excitement is in the air.  It's
definitely been a chaotic day with emotions going high and low.  Ayla
has been singing her heart out, she even recorded one on Mommy's phone
and sent it to me.  Wyatt and I hav play many rounds of Minecraft,
installed a crazy number of new mods, and got a few rounds of 0AD in.


Best of all we had a special supper, and enjoyed a movie all together,
that's right Wyatt, the king of not being able to stay put for 5 mintues
enjoyed at least half a movie with us before we cut out early to go
play.  I am so grateful that I have this time off to enjoy with them and
see them just so happy and joyful.

Merry Christmas Everyone.
