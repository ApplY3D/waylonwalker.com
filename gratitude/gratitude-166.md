article_html: '<p>Happy Birthday Rhiannon, I love the chill day that we had.  Sometimes

  Birthdays get over hyped the the kids kinda go over board, but today

  they just did fantastic.  We started with a great trip to Hy Vee to pick

  up the cake, flowers, and a few extras.  We came back and set up

  decorations just in time for my first and only real meeting of the day.

  Had a good lunch date that included pop tarts and a cinnamon role

  doughnut.  Then Rhiannon spent the afternoon dying her hair, and it came

  out with just the most vibrant purple, it looks so good on her.

  Finished up the day with a great potato soup, as requested, and cake.

  Getting ready to go kick her butt in game night now.  Just because it''s

  her birthday does not mean she can''t lose at some games.</p>'
