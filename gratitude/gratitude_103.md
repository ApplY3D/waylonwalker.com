  a wild

  things that we all need day in and day out.  Then vacation hit and all

  use the extra time to do fun things with them that we normally have not

  been doing.</p>

  <p>This morning Wyatt and I finished Wally his robot dog.  It was so cute,

  and he loved it.  Honestly the kit was super cool, complicated, and the

  directions were only mostly there.  It turned into a lot of can you

  find A15 for me, do you want to cut it, thank you, this is where I am

  going to put it.  He loved watchig it come together, but I could feel

  that it was too much for him to do, even with help.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we went out to the front and went skating/bike riding.

  Everyone did great, and Ayla made some really good improvements on

  riding her bike uphill.  She was making it uphill with less and less

  help each time.</p>

  <p>Finally after supper Wyatt Ayla and I all built things in scratch.  Ayla

  sang the most beautiful song, and I animated the ballerina that she

  picked out to sing her song.  Then Wyatt made a Dream Character move and

  fight a boss, he drew a custom sword, and I make it so the sword

  followed dream.</p>
