First full day with Dobby home went fantastically!   We did have one accident inside the house, he let me know that he needed to go, but I wanted to put real pants on first.  Well that didn't work out so well, peed right as I set him down.  We live and we learn.  At least we still have a really good pet spot vac from Gizmo's final year where he really started to have some serious bladder issues.


Last night was date night.  It was super fun we are really getting back into the flow of watching supercross every Saturday again.  It brings back a ton of memories for me, as I have watched almost every race since
2005.  It's just been so fun to get back into it with Rhiannon.
