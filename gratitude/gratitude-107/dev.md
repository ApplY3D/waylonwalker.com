Happy New Years  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.  Today we played Hangry, a new game that we got for Christmas as a whole family.  It was a freaking blast!  The whole family was belly laughing through most of it.  I am so grateful that Rhiannon was able to tough through at least one round of it despite her illness that's coming on.
