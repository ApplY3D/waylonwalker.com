In my 32 years I cannot recall ever dropping an f-bomb in front of my mom, heck
besides a short period in my life were I developed shop mouth I rarely drop
one.  Like twice a year at most.  Tonight it was not only in her presence, it
was directed right at her.  I am still processing how I feel about it, but I
think it was a discussion that was a long time coming that we needed to have.
I'm glad to get it off my chest, but I also feel lost and not quite sure where
to go from here.
