Getting back into the rythm.  It's so interesting how easily a good habit can
die.  I stopped journeling here for a few days and used that time to prepare
for a conference talk, which seemed to go pretty well, and well a week has gone
by with no more posts.

Today Rhiannon and I started Casey Neistat's monthly .com course and I am
excited to learn storytelling and video production from such an icon.  But
probably more importantly I am excited to enjoy it with Rhiannon.  I feel like
we are at such a great place in our releationship and little activities like
this really do help bring us even closer together, and understand one another
even more as we grow together.
