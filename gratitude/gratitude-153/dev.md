Whew, an exhausting day.  Packing, running with Dobby and the kids, and fully scooped the drive at two houses.  We had our first chance to just hang out as a family at the new house, and it was pretty nice.  The kids had a ton of energy as one would expect, but it was nice to actually spend some non rushed time there to really poke around at OUR HOUSE.
