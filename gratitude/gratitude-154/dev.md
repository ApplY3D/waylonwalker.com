Big play session tonight with Dobby and the kids, everyone was sprinting through the basement like crazy.  All with HUGE smiles on their face. We ran so hard for so long that eventually dobby just stopped and laid down.

While Dobby and Wyatt got a good cuddle session.  Wyatt was so happy.  He said that it was soo calming for him and he just loved it.  Generally they are both just so high energy that Wyatt inadvertantly gets nipped and does not like it.

Also got a bunch of boxes packed up!
