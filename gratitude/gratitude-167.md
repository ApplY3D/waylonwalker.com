  to when I was cleaning out and installing washer and dryer.  I had

  pushed the washer in and out like 3 times.  well on the last time I

  decided not I probably was not done yet and I was not going to button it

  up.  Instead I would leave it out a few inches and not install the drain

  hose, because it was probably coming back out soon again anyways.

  Weeealll.... I kinda forgot about this later as I finished mopping up

  and decided to just nudge it back into place on my way out.</p>

  <p>So today I wake up to a backed up sink, and after many hours of trying

  to unclog it, I go to the basement to explore for another cleanout

  somewhere.  Maybe there is something down here that can reach the clog.

  Well to my surprise I walk into the guest bedroom to find two ceiling

  tiles on the floor, about a dozen ruined, along with some mattress

  sheets.  At first I was in complete disbelief of what I was actually

  looking at, until I remembered what had happened a few weeks ago.</p>

  <p>I am so grateful that it simply dropped through some ceiling tiles, and

  onto a tiled floor.  Made for not too bad of a cleanup.  Now as a

  homeowner I get to fix it and now answer to a landlord.</p>

  <p>Lesson learned, water on the floor equals check the basement.</p>'
