#### Happy Anniversary

Its been 8 great years so far.  We have grown together so much along the way.  I don't think that we could have every planned out our path to get where we are today 8 years ago.  We did know one thing, that we would be here together.  We fight whatever challenges come our way together.  We can beat anything as long as we stick together on the same page.  trouble comes as soon as we loose sight  of that and work alone.  Together we have grown so much more than either of us could have done alone. There are challenges that neither of us could have conquered alone.  I cannot imagine myself facing these challenges with anyone else.  I know that we can defeat whatever comes our way in the future, because together we are strong.  I Love you Rhiannon Walker, _Forever and Ever_.
