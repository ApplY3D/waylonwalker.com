#### Great Friends

I am grateful that I have such great friends that are able to help us through a very difficult time.  Today I am able to work and not have to worry about Rhiannon or the kids, knowing that someone is home with them.  The peace of mind is invaluable when you have a family member with a severe medical issue.
