  <p>Today I am very grateful for all of the wonderful birthday wishes.  I started

  off the day with two very excited kids.  They couldn''t wait to wake up, give

  daddy a big hug and wish him happy birthday today.  My kids love them some

  birthday wishes and do all they can to make the birthday person  feel special.

  Next the text messages started to roll in.  It is nice to hear from everyone

  that I havent heard from in awhile.  At night Scott Volunteered to bathe the

  kids, and get pajammas on them, while I was able to spend a  bit more time with

  Rhiannon.  Speaking of which...</p>

  <p>I didn''t forget the most special of all.  Rhiannon, my beautiful wife, was a

  soldier  today.  She got up, forgone the medicine, and headed out with me

  bright and early to take the kids to Pre-K, get coffee, and run various

  errands.  In which we ran into smoke on several occassions that nearly took her

  down.  While I was out taking Wyatt to therapy, and picking up Ayla.  She

  muscled through and finished my quilt, wrapped my presents, and cooked an

  amazing jumbalya!!</p>

  <p>All in all this was one of the best days I have had in awhile, Thanks everyone!</p>'

#### Happy Birthday

Today I am very grateful for all of the wonderful birthday wishes.  I started
off the day with two very excited kids.  They couldn't wait to wake up, give
daddy a big hug and wish him happy birthday today.  My kids love them some
birthday wishes and do all they can to make the birthday person  feel special.
Next the text messages started to roll in.  It is nice to hear from everyone
that I havent heard from in awhile.  At night Scott Volunteered to bathe the
kids, and get pajammas on them, while I was able to spend a  bit more time with
Rhiannon.  Speaking of which...

I didn't forget the most special of all.  Rhiannon, my beautiful wife, was a
soldier  today.  She got up, forgone the medicine, and headed out with me
bright and early to take the kids to Pre-K, get coffee, and run various
errands.  In which we ran into smoke on several occassions that nearly took her
down.  While I was out taking Wyatt to therapy, and picking up Ayla.  She
muscled through and finished my quilt, wrapped my presents, and cooked an
amazing jumbalya!!


All in all this was one of the best days I have had in awhile, Thanks everyone!
