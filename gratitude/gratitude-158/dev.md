Cabinets are cleaned up, well to the best of my ability, and are geting filled up.  You might not think this is such a big deal, or what crazy person needs to clean the cabinets of their new house before putting anything in them...

Well let me tell you these had 20 years of greasy grime and dust coating them making them feel like a fly trap, giving the kitchen its own special smell and just waiting for the next poor bug to land on it.

This was so bad that on the last ones nearest to the stove I had to pull out the paint thinner to get the bulk of it off.  in the end they still feel slightly sticky.  Anyways, thanks very much to, not a sponsor, Drill Brush for making this happen.
