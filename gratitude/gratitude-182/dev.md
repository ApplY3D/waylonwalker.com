Crutches are gone, whoop whoop!  But dang this leg is weak.  It's crazy how much strength you loose after 3 weeks of no weight bearing, but also impressive to see how quickly it starts coming back.  After just half the day back on my feet I am walking without crutches pretty well.

Wyatt has been so helpful lately it has been very impressive.  Since our big meltdown night he has been ready to help without too much push back.  This has been a huge relief and really helped get through the tail end of this stint on crutches.
