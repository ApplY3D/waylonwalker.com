Glances is a system monitor with a ton of features, including docker processes.

I have started using portainer to look at running docker processes, its a great
heavy-weight docker process monitor.  glances works as a great lightweight
monitor to just give you the essentials, ( Name, Status, CPU%, MEM, /MAX,
IOR/s, IOW/s, Rx/s, Tx/s, Command)

## install

You will need to install glances to use the glances webui.  We can still use
`pipx` to manage our virtual environment for us so that we do not need to do so
manually or run the risk of globally installed package dependency hell.

``` bash
pipx install glances
pipx inject glances "glances[docker]"
```

You will be presented with this success message.

``` bash
  injected package glances into venv glances
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```

## results

Now running glances will also show information about your running docker
containers.
