This was my first time ever streaming on [twitch.tv/waylonwalker](https://twitch.tv/waylonwalker).  I am excited to get going. I have been streaming early in the morning while I am still waking up, so still a bit groggy as I go.

## Kedro Spaceflights

It all started with [kedro/issues/606](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues/606), Yetu called out for users of kedro to record themselves doing a walk through of their tutorials.  I wanted to do this, but was really stuck at the fact that recording or editing somewhat polished vide is quite time consuming for me.
