This was my first time ever streaming on
[twitch.tv/waylonwalker](https://twitch.tv/waylonwalker).  I am excited to get going.
I have been streaming early in the morning while I am still waking up, so still
a bit groggy as I go.

## Kedro Spaceflights

It all started with
[kedro/issues/606](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues/606), Yetu
called out for users of kedro to record themselves doing a walk through of
their tutorials.  I wanted to do this, but was really stuck at the fact that
recording or editing somewhat polished vide is quite time consuming for me.

## Notes

``` bash
pipx run kedro new
cd project
python -m venv .venv
