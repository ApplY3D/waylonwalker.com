I see you there, trying to script out your tmux layouts. Tryig to get each project setup just perfect with a script, but you keep stumbling over yourself with `duplicate session` error messages

The `has-session` tmux command is a handy tool to prevent this `duplicate session` error message when scripting your tmux layouts.

## command line

The command is pretty straight forward, you simply ask tmux if the session name you are looking for exists.

``` bash
tmux has-session -t "waylonwalker_com"
```
