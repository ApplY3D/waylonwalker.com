This one starts a new chapter in our series that is going to open up a whole
new set of workflow productivity options, understanding how the `new-session`
command is a critical command in our adventure into tmux glory.  This is going
to open the door for some seriously game changing hotkeys and scripting.

``` bash
# create a new session
tmux new-session

# create a new session detached
tmux new-session -d


# create a new session and name it
tmux new-session -s me

# create a new named session and attach to it if one exists
tmux new-session -As me
```
