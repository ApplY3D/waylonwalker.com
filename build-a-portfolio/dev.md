Follow this over time.  If you want to use code repositories for your portfolio. Make sure that you have made it unique in some way.  Think about what kind of signal you are sending to hiring managers if you are linking to a project with no docs, and one commit from 3 days ago.  

They don't have to be PERFECT either, it's likely that it's not something you were paid to do, hence not able to put your full time into. Just having something that generally follows some GOOD practice will set you above most other candidates. 

Make sure that it reflects you as a person.  The worst that can happen is for you to hire in based on some false pretense and hate where you end up.

👌 It does not need to be perfect
