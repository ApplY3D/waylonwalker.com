Now that we are splitting up work into their own sessions, lets talk about how
to navigate between them without the command line.  Navigating sessions is what
kept me using a too many splits and windows workflow for far too long.  It was
rough, I was always tripping over panes and windows until I got too frustrated
and just ran `tmux kill-server`  to start on a new blank slate.

``` bash
bind -n M-P switch-client -p
bind -n M-N switch-client -n
```
