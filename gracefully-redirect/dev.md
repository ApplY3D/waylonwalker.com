title: Refactoring your blog urls
---

I just did a quick refactoring of my JAMStack blog urls.  Some didn't fit with my style, some had `_` that I wanted to switch to `-`, and others were ridiculously long.  I've been using forestry as my CMS, I write many of my posts there, and sometimes it picks some crazy file names (based on my titles). It was time to refactor.

## ðŸ–Š Rename posts _change the filename_

My post urls are based on the file name of my markdown file, so I can simply go through my filesystem and rename anything I want.  From here its probably best to only commit the addition of the new file name, until the redirects clear, but these are all low traffic posts for me so I just commited both at once.

> Safely redirect without breaking links

## _redirects â¤´ _/redirects_

I am hosted on netlify, which automatically puts very âš¡ performant redirects on the edge based on a `/_redirects` route on your site.  So I added a redirect from the old route to the new route there.

## rename long posts

``` bash 
/blog/i-finally-fixed-my-styled-components-in-gatsby-js
/blog/fix-styled-components-in-gatsby
/blog/interrogate-is-a-pretty-awesome-brand-new-cli-for-python-packages
/blog/interrogate
```

## pedantic ðŸ¤” _probably_

This is probably being a bit pedantic.  Realistically my urls were probably ok. These posts probably aren't going to be topping the google search charts anyways, but I wanted to do it without killing off any links that I may have happened to post somewhere.
