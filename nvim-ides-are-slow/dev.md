## It's ok

Use a graphical IDE if it works for you.

## Trick it out

vim is so well integrated into the terminal, take advantage

## It wasn't working for me anymore

[//]: <> (seriously,)

## dozens of instances

As a team lead I bounce betweeen a dozen projects a per day

[//]: <> (Trying to run more than one instance of an ide is hard, especially when) [//]: <> (projects are so similar and all start looking the same.)

## Move With Intent

Running vim inside tmux lets me move swiftly between the exact project I need.

[//]: <> (I'm sure there are other ways do do this, I bet you can get a vim plugin to do this)

## Other Things That Make this Possible

* tmux
* direnv

> vim adjacent things

[//]: <> (## Check messages)


[//]: <> (a short interruption where I am called back to work where I show flying swiftly) [//]: <> (between projects with the perfect intent.)

## yes, vim is ugly, make it yours

@rook
``` vim
command! Q :q
```

@_waylonwalker
``` vim
nnoremap <leader>6 <c-^>
```


[//]: <> (__)

## lsp


``` vim
lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()
```

## treesitter


``` vim
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects'
```

## telescope

fuzzy matching like a boss

fzf is ok too

## Check Messages

[//]: <> (Another interruption comes in, this time the change uses the lsp and some custom bindings) [//]: <> (Data Pipeline is down.) [//]: <> (* Use the lsp go to definition.) [//]: <> (* Open data in visidata) [//]: <> (* use jumplist to get back) [//]: <> (* make the fix) [//]: <> (* use fugitive to commit)
