Break-pane is a handy tmux command when your layout gets too cramped and you want to just move a split into its own window.  Calling `break-pane` does exactly that, it creates a `new-window` for you and moves your currently selected split into that window

Default key binding for `break-pane`

``` bash
bind-key          ! break-pane
```
