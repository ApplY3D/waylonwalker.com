An ultimate productivity key-binding in tmux is one to switch to the last session.  I use this to quickly get between sessions really quick.  Often I am working and need to lookup a quick note, or copy something into my notes, then get back to where I was quickly.

``` bash
bind -n M-b switch-client -l
```

I think of this hub and spoke model, and use `last-session` to quickly drive it.
