ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Waylon Walker.  I Love creating things on the web, learning, and
teaching others.  I created my blogging platform from scratch to learn about building tools with pluggy and diskcache.  I was frustrated with long build times, black holes of node modules, bloated pages, and a lack of built in SEO tools.

I am currently a Data Analytics team lead where I do a lot of code review, pair programming, infrastructure, CI/CD, and devops.  I build data pipelines with pandas and the fantasic kedro framework.
