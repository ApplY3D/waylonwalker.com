I am challenging myself to 30 days of dotfile ricing.  I have been on linux desktop for a few months now and have a pretty good workflow going, I have the coarse edits done to my workflow, but it has some rough edges that need sanded down.  It's time to squash some of those little annoyances that still exist in my setup.


This is primarily going to be focused on productivity, but may have  a few things to just look better.  This will comprise heavily of aliases, zsh, and nvim config.
