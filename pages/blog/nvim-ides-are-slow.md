### topics
* lsp

* I use tmux
* quickfix

### idea

Rather than saying vim is fast lets fix some things live.  While we are trying
to present on how fast vim is, popups will iterrupt with critical production
failures that need fixed straight away.

### interruptions

Data Pipeline is down. 

* Use the lsp go to definition.
* Open data in visidata
* use jumplist to get back
* make the fix
* use fugitive to commit

### todo

* design obs popup

## The slides
