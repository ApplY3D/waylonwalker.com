This is a listing of all the things that I use on a daily basis to build data
pipelines, lead my team, and build this website.


## Installation

Everything installed on my machines is done through ansible-playbooks.  It's
been a long transformation to get here, but its so satisfying to boot a brand
new system, run a single command a have every single thing cofigured exactly to
my liking.


``` bash
# GET is available by default on Ubuntu
GET waylonwalker.com/bootstrap | bash

# For debian based systems without GET by default
sudo apt install curl
curl -F https://waylonwalker.com/bootstrap | bash
```

## OS

I run Ubuntu, it works well for me without too much fuss.  For me the
distribution does not really matter too much, I'm more interested in what's
inside.

## Window Manager

I use awesome wm.  Awesome is a tiling window manager that alows me to navigate
through 9 workspaces (technically called tags in awesomewm). I can script out
certain applications to open in a certain tag, move it to different tags, and
join tags super easy.  I really dont see myself going back to a floating window
manager where you have to place all your windows with the mouse by hand.  This
is probably one of the biggest selling points for me to move to a Linux
desktop.

## Terminal

### gnome-terminal

I typically just use gnome-terminal.  It works, for the most part it gets out
of the way and lets me do what I want.  I just want a terminal that runs tmux
properly, runs without titltbars or scrollbars, and lets me theme it without
much effort.

### kitty

I generally keep a backup terminal. I have botched `gnome-terminal` in the past
by linking the system python to python3.8 instead of python3.6 as
gnome-terminal expected.  I was able to hop into my backup terminal without
opening up a tty to get back going.

I really wanted kitty to work, and images to just work into my workflow, but I
use tmux and it does not always play nicely with kitty.L

Overall though kitty is nice, its easy to theme, make look good, a breeze to
install, and has some great features that someone not running tmux would
probably really like.  I have tmux scripting so deeply integrated into my
workflow that its hard for me to use kitty.
