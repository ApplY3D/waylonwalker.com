# Story


# Promise

I will check the house in the middle of the night when there are noises no
matter how tired I am.  I know that it causes you really strong feelings that
you cannot shake until its been checked.

I promise to sit by your side when you are down, no matter how many times we
re-watch Big Bang Theory it will never be too much.  I know it's not your first
choice, but sometimes its your only choice.  Your body needs extra rest to
fight this viscious disease.


# support

I will accept support on my bad days.  I know that I try to be the rock of the
family and push until I cannot push anymore, no matter how much you tell me to
rest.  I really do appreciate when you take notice that things are going harder
than normal.
