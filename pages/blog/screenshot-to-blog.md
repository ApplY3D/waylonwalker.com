When I am creating blog posts it's often helpful to add screenshots to them to
illustrate what I see on my screen.  Sometimes I lack good screenshots in my
posts because it just takes more effort than I have in the moment, and I
prioritize making content over making perfect content.

## Making Screenshots

When I have something to take a screenshot of, I need to take the shot,
optimize the image, often convert it to a better format, publish it, and
create a the img tag in my blog.
