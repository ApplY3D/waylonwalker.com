limits, but they loose their meaning. Services like bit.ly will save my links
for me so that I can find them, but I would rather them to be easy to remember.

## 301 ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I recently discovered a really cool feature of netlify that I have always looked past, `_redirects`. It is so simple cool and powerful, every netlify site should do this!

## But how ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

simply add a `_redirects` file to the root of your your published site with the following format. The trick I found with my gatsby site was that it needed to be in my static directory `/static/_redirects`, not root. Next you just put space separated links on separate lines. #'s can be used for comments.

``` markdown
# netlify redirects
# from_url to_url

## üôå Share those short links

Now with shorter links we have more space for our content without needing to use a service like bit.ly that makes our links unreadable.
